# Wise Publishing Frontend Challenge 

## Start Project:
To start the project, navigate towards the wisejobs folder and run the php artisan server command to start it and go to localhost:8000 in your web browser.

You would have to register and create a login which will bring you to the Job Posts page, I suspect the data won't actually carry over from my local environment to git so you'll have to manually create some companies and jobs. 


## Thoughts:
Granted with the fact I had to learn some Laravel to even get started on this project. I found the framework itself to be enjoyable with its ability to quickly load changes I made to the backend, it really sped up development compared to the world of Django development that I'm from. Pagination and Filtering was definitely an easier task to pull off in Laravel(with the help of the internet of course).

This challenge actually got me interested in making a project of my own in the framework.

Unfortunately as earlier noted about my inexperience in Laravel I wasn't able to complete a bit of the website, particularly updating and deleting a job post and deleting a company, ran into some bugs and time ran out as well some componentizing etc. I am greatful for the opportunity and I'm glad I was able to try out Laravel!
